# ZIKR Full Remediation Report

**Date:** 15 August 2026  
**Repository:** `mohamedalaa7785-cpu/Zikr`  
**Production:** [zikrmediaofficial.vercel.app](https://zikrmediaofficial.vercel.app)  
**Supabase project:** `eydxvcamhjhajxjrsgym`  
**Current commit:** `0f512c8` (`docs: publish final remediation evidence`)

## Executive status

ZIKR is operational on the current production deployment and the main application verification path is green. The final validation found no current production-audit issues, no current-deployment Vercel runtime errors, a successful CircleCI verification, a successful production Vercel deployment, and a clean local working tree. The repository and Supabase migration history now include the two RLS remediation migrations that were applied to production.

The project is **not honestly described as advisor-zero or completely constraint-free** because Supabase still reports two external configuration warnings: `pg_net` is installed in the `public` extension namespace, while its HTTP functions are used from the `net` schema by active cron jobs; and leaked-password protection cannot be enabled on the current Free plan because Supabase documents that feature as Pro-and-above. These are documented below. No security control was weakened to hide them.

## Critical issues found and fixed

| Area | Root cause | Fix | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| Supabase RLS performance | 35 tables had overlapping permissive policies, mainly public SELECT policies overlapping admin `ALL` policies and duplicate owner policies | Added `20260815115851_cleanup_multiple_permissive_policies.sql`; split admin writes by command, removed redundant owner policies, consolidated playlist and subscription policies, and preserved admin predicates | Security/performance advisor and policy queries; the final performance advisor has zero `multiple_permissive_policies` warnings |
| `video_categories` RLS | One identical legacy UPDATE policy remained beside the new admin UPDATE policy | Added `20260815120950_remove_video_categories_policy_overlap.sql`, dropping only `update_video_categories` and retaining `private.is_admin_user()` in the command-specific policy | Final performance advisor: 98 INFO notices only, zero WARNs and zero policy-overlap findings |
| Migration replay | The cleanup migration directly referenced `social_publish_queue` and `subscriptions`, but the legacy replay baseline intentionally does not contain those tables | Added `to_regclass()` guards around both policy-repair blocks; production behavior is unchanged when the tables exist, while clean replay no longer fails | `pnpm supabase:migrations:replay`: `ALL_MIGRATIONS_PASSED` |
| GitHub branch governance | `main` was previously unprotected | Enabled protection requiring `ci/circleci: verify`, blocking force-push and deletion, and requiring conversation resolution | GitHub API returned the active protection configuration |
| CI replacement | GitHub-hosted runner access remains blocked by an account-level billing lock | Kept GitHub workflow as a manual fallback and used CircleCI for push verification | CircleCI job #23 passed the full `pnpm verify` suite |
| Production route/API reliability | Earlier fixes addressed malformed JSON handling, negative pagination, cache write exposure, and authentication/OAuth redirects | Retained and validated those changes end-to-end | Production route smoke test and audit returned expected status codes |

## Database, migrations, and RLS

The repository now contains **127 canonical migration files**. Supabase production also reports 127 migration versions, including both `cleanup_multiple_permissive_policies` and `remove_video_categories_policy_overlap`. The migration checker reported no duplicate versions, and the in-memory PGlite replay applied every migration successfully.

All inspected application tables have RLS enabled. Sensitive profile, user-activity, notification, location, and internal scheduler tables use ownership or service/admin predicates. Public content policies remain limited to published or active content. The targeted RLS changes never grant a regular authenticated user admin access.

The final Supabase Performance Advisor result contained 98 INFO-level `unused_index` notices and no WARN-level multiple-permissive-policy findings. The unused indexes were not dropped blindly because several are valid query-support indexes for growing Quran, content, search, prayer, and user-data workloads. Removing them without production query statistics could create regressions.

The cron verification query at 12:22 UTC showed both jobs active on `* * * * *` and returning `succeeded` with `1 row`:

| Job | Schedule | Active | Recent result |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `zikr-prayer-push-dispatch` | `* * * * *` | Yes | Succeeded repeatedly through 12:22 UTC |
| `zikr-video-processing` | `* * * * *` | Yes | Succeeded repeatedly through 12:22 UTC |

## Authentication and Google OAuth

The production `/auth/google` flow returns a 307 redirect to the project Supabase authorization endpoint with `provider=google`, PKCE challenge parameters, `prompt=select_account`, and a callback target of `https://zikrmediaofficial.vercel.app/auth/callback`. Supabase then returns the expected Google authorization redirect with the configured client ID and Supabase callback URL. The bare callback route correctly rejects a request without an authorization code rather than creating a session.

The production checks also returned HTTP 200 for `/auth/login`, `/mushaf`, `/quran`, `/prayer-times`, `/qibla`, the Quran surah API, Hadith books API, Dua categories API, Prophets API, the web manifest, and robots.txt. Prayer times returned HTTP 200 with valid Cairo coordinates and method 4. A request without required prayer coordinates returned the intended HTTP 400 validation response.

## GitHub and Vercel

Commit `0f512c8` is present on both local `main` and `origin/main`; the working tree is clean. GitHub branch protection now requires the real CircleCI status context `ci/circleci: verify`, with force-push and deletion disabled. CircleCI job #23 passed and reported `Your tests passed on CircleCI!`.

The latest Vercel production deployment for the final commit is `4fqYypkBoYHhEPWyGsjLNwyDc2N7` and is complete; it targets production and is associated with the final report commit. The preceding code deployment `dpl_CDEBwmeGpe1Dxf3J4eHzbT4eTrTv` was also `READY` and associated with commit `e06dec8`. It serves the aliases `zikrmediaofficial.vercel.app`, `zikr-zikr.vercel.app`, and `zikr-git-main-zikr.vercel.app`. Runtime log filtering for the code deployment and the final production deployment returned no error or fatal entries in the checked windows.

The GitHub aggregate status still shows an unrelated failed context for `Vercel – v0-project` with the message “Deployment rate limited — retry in 24 hours.” This is a separate Vercel v0 project and does not represent the ZIKR project deployment. The ZIKR Vercel context and CircleCI context are both successful.

## Tests and production evidence

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Migration canonical-version check | Passed; 127 migrations, no duplicate versions |
| Full migration replay | Passed; `ALL_MIGRATIONS_PASSED` |
| Required route and asset check | Passed; 75 required ZIKR routes/assets |
| Local import smoke check | Passed |
| Mobile readiness check | Passed with release-configuration warnings only |
| ESLint | Passed |
| TypeScript `tsc --noEmit` | Passed |
| Automated tests | Passed; 56 tests, 11 suites, 0 failures |
| Next.js production build | Passed; Next.js 16.3.1/Turbopack compiled and generated pages |
| CircleCI full verify | Passed; job #23 |
| Vercel production deployment | Passed; deployment `dpl_CDE...` READY |
| Production page/API audit | Passed; 0 issues, 40 declared routes, 156 public 200 responses, 68,766 sitemap URLs |
| Current deployment runtime errors | None found in filtered two-hour window |
| Cron jobs | Both active and repeatedly succeeded |

The local build emitted fallback logs because the sandbox did not contain `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`; the build still completed successfully, and production has its configured environment variables. No secret was added to source code or client bundles. The mobile readiness check also correctly warned that release-specific Android and iOS association identifiers must be supplied before publishing native binaries; this does not affect the web PWA.

## Remaining issues and deployment requirements

| Item | Status | Required action |
|---|---|---|
| Supabase leaked-password protection | External limitation | Upgrade the Supabase organization/project to Pro or above, then enable the setting in Authentication → Attack Protection. It cannot be enabled on the current Free plan. |
| `pg_net` extension namespace | External/configuration warning | Do not move it blindly. First create a tested staging branch and verify every cron call; production currently depends on `net.http_post()` and all cron runs are succeeding. |
| Unused indexes | INFO only | Review with real query statistics after traffic grows; do not delete wholesale. |
| GitHub Actions runner billing lock | External account limitation | Resolve the GitHub billing/account lock if GitHub-hosted CI is desired. CircleCI is the active free push-based verification path and is passing. |
| v0 project rate limit | Separate project limitation | No ZIKR code change is required; wait for the rate-limit window or manage the separate v0 project plan. |
| Native app association identifiers | Release configuration | Set `ANDROID_APP_LINKS_SHA256` and `IOS_ASSOCIATED_DOMAIN_APP_ID` before Play Store/App Store release. |
| Historical Vercel error clusters | Historical logs | Current deployment filtering found none. Continue monitoring after new traffic; the affected routes are now guarded/fallback-safe in the current code. |
